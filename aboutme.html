			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>Well..... I don't know if I really want to answer that...... This is a tough one, ya know?<br>
			If I do this, you guys will know more about me, which would rid me of my privacy... <br>
			But on the other hand, this page <i>is</i> about me, so I gotta do at least <i>something</i>, right?</p>
			<p>Ah, I know! I'll tell you guys about me, but I won't include stuff that's too private (such as my address, or real name)</p>
			<p>So, I shall introduce myself as <strong>Mr. X</strong>....</p>
			<p>No hang on.... This is <i>waayyyyy</i> to clich√©....</p>
			<p>Wait! I know something! Why don't I just call myself <strong>Mr. Y</strong>. Much better, am I right?</p>

			<h2>My hobbies</h2>
			<p>So I've got quite a few hobbies:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>I swim competitively, and I'm a lifeguard at the beach of <a href="https://www.wrb.biz/" target="_blank">Wassenaar</a>.</p>
						<strong>Swimming</strong>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Gaming</strong>
						<p>You can find my game info by clicking <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/OptimusRobertus/">here.</a></p>

					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Cubing</strong>
						<p>For those who don't know, cubing is playing with Rubik's cubes. What a surprise, right? <br>
						The goal is to get the cube as fast as you possibly can to a solved state, like you can see in the following video:</p>
						<p>I'm not this fast unfortunately. My fastest solve ever is 14.73 seconds, so I've still got a <em>loooooong</em> way to go.</p>
					</li>					
				</ul>

			<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
			<p>You're probably wondering why I've made this seemingly irrelevant website. And, most importantly, why it is a website about a brown bear, but I start rambling about myself. Well, I'm going to explain that to you right now:<br>
			You see, I'm still in high school. One of my courses is (as the Dutch call it) "Informatica". During these lessons, we learn how to code, and right now, we're learning how to do HTML and CSS. This was one of our projects. What we had to do, was fix a page's HTML and CSS, and add our own page to it, which is what I just did.</p>
			<p>I really hope you liked this page, and if you want to give me feedback, just <a href="mailto:110127@st-maartenscollege.nl">email me.</a></p>
